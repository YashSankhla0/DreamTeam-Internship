🌡 Temperature Prediction Using Historical Weather Data

> Developed during my internship at *Dreamteam Technologies Pvt. Ltd.*

🚀 Project Overview

This project uses 10 years of hourly weather data (2014–2024, 87,000+ records) to build a linear regression model that forecasts short-term temperature trends based on environmental factors.

🔍 Key Steps

1. *Load & Clean the Data*
   Converted numeric types, handled missing values, ensured consistency.

2. *Filter for September 10 AM*  
   Ensured model training on uniform conditions.

3. *Feature Engineering*  
   Created TEMP_CHANGE to represent the temperature shift each hour.

4. *Train the Model*  
   Applied Linear Regression using humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover.

5. *Make Predictions*  
   Predicted the next hour's temperature change.

6. *Forecast 12 Hours Ahead*  
   Simulated temperature for 12 future hourly steps under constant conditions.

7. *Visualize Results*  
   Displayed predicted trend via a line chart.
